1. Calculate median for accident_severity caused by various "Motorcycle"

WITH CTE3 AS (
SELECT
a.accident_severity AS accident_severity,
v.vehicle_type AS vehicle_type_number,
vt.vehicle_type_name AS label,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY label ORDER BY accident_severity) AS 	rownumber,
COUNT(1) OVER (PARTITION BY vehicle_type_name) AS count_of_severity

select LABEL,accident_severity,rownumber from CTE3 where rownumber between (count_of_severity+1)/2  and (count_of_severity+2)/2;

2. Evaluate accident severity and total accidents per vehicle type

SELECT
count(a.accident_index),a.accident_severity AS 	accident_severity,v.vehicle_type AS 	vehicle_type_number,vt.vehicle_type_name AS label
FROM accident a

LEFT OUTER JOIN vehicle_types vt ON v.vehicle_type = vt.vehicle_code

......................................................................................................................//;

3. Calculate average severity by vehical type;

SELECT
round(AVG(a.accident_severity)) AS    accident_severity,vt.vehicle_type_name AS Vehical_type
FROM accident a
LEFT OUTER JOIN vehicles v ON a.accident_index = v.accident_index
LEFT OUTER JOIN vehicle_types vt ON v.vehicle_type = vt.vehicle_code
group by 2;

.......................................................................................................................//;

4. Calcuate average severity and total accidents by motorcycle;

SELECT
Count(a.accident_index) as 	Total_accidents,round(AVG(a.accident_severity)) AS 	average_accident_severity,vt.vehicle_type_name AS Vehical_type
FROM accident a
LEFT OUTER JOIN vehicles v ON a.accident_index = v.accident_index
LEFT OUTER JOIN vehicle_types vt ON v.vehicle_type = vt.vehicle_code
where Vehical_type like '%otorcycle%'
group by 3;
